As a Danish study shows, parental income determines our life chances – but in what way differs according to how rich they are

```bash
parental income 父母收入
determine 
```

Parents shape our lives. There’s the love or <span style="color: red;">its absence</span> and the genetics. On the financial side, academics focus on <span style="color: red;">intergenerational income persistence</span> (how much parental income determines our own) and <span style="color: red;">its inverse</span> (social mobility).

```bash
There’s the love or its absence
intergenerational income persistence 代际收入持续性

```

This varies between countries. Economist Miles Corak has shown that <span style="color: red;">higher inequality</span> nations tend to be less socially mobile. When the <span style="color: red;">rungs on the ladder</span> are far apart, individuals born poor struggle to climb them.

```bash
vary-various-variation-variaty 变化 - 各种各样的 - 变异 - 多样性
rungs on the ladder/ˈlædə(r)/ 梯子上的横档
```

However, these comparisons of average mobility levels between countries <span style="color: red;">hide something important</span>: differences within a country in how parents’ economic circumstances shape their children’s. That is the <span style="color: red;">key takeaway</span> from a new Danish study that tracked more than 630,000 children born between 1972 and 1982.

```bash
hide something important
key takeaway 关键要点; takeaway外卖
```

Examining the relationship between parental income and that of their <span style="color: red;">offspring</span> in their mid-30s, the study confirms the obvious: richer parents <span style="color: red;">beget</span> richer kids.

```bash
offspring 后代;结果；产物
beget 生育，得到
```

More interesting is how economic outcomes of those from low-, middle- and top-income households <span style="color: red;">are affected by</span> their parents’ financial circumstances. For those with lowest incomes, the main way in which your parents being slightly better off increases your own earnings is by raising the chance of you working at all.

```bash

```

Among middle-income families, it’s education, not employment, that matters. Higher income households have more highly educated children. But for the top 5%, something new happens: rich parents boost the next generation’s <span style="color: red;">prosperity</span> via higher <span style="color: red;">capital income</span> (returns on owning assets). So it’s the <span style="color: red;">passing on of assets</span> that keeps the very rich, rich. Our parents shape us all, but in very different ways.

```bash
prosperity 繁荣
capital income 资本收入
passing on of assets 资产传承
```
