## Title : Climate crisis **exposed** people **to** extra six weeks of dangerous heat in 2024

exposed to 把...暴露在...中

#### Name two words related to climate crisis

<span style="color: red;">carbon emission (碳排放) </span>
:carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth's atmosphere,which is a key driver of climate crisis.

<span style="color: red;">extreme weather (极端天气)</span> :The climate crisis increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes(飓风;Typhoon-台风),wildfires（山火）,and heatwaves,disrupting ecosystem and human societies.

####  Three Phenomena（现象 phenomenon的复数） Closely Related to "Global Warming" in Daily Life
1. <span style="color: red;">Rising Temperatures</span> - More frequent and intense(强烈的；剧烈的；紧张的；热情的) heatwaves make summers hotter, affecting health, agriculture, and daily activities.
2. <span style="color: red;">Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels</span> - Coastal cities experience more flooding due to melting glaciers and polar ice caps.
3. <span style="color: red;">Shifts in Seasonal Patterns （季节变化）</span>- Earlier springs and unpredictable weather patterns impact agriculture, wildlife behavior, and allergy seasons(过敏季节).

#### 正文
Analysis shows fossil fuels （化石燃料）are causing global heating, which are supercharging heatwaves, leaving millions prone to deadly temperatures

```bash
化石燃料: coal(煤)   gas petrol(汽油)
fuel -v 加剧
supercharge 加剧
prone to == easier to be infuenced 有...的倾向
```

The climate crisis caused an additional six weeks of dangerously hot days in 2024 for the average person, supercharging the fatal impact of heatwaves around the world.

```bash
extra = additional
average person = common person
fatal = deadly 致命的,绝定性的 ##前者侧重后果，后者侧重描述事物的属性
```

The effects of human-caused global heating were far worse for some people, an analysis by World Weather Attribution (WWA) and Climate Central has shown. Those in Caribbean and Pacific island states were the hardest hit. Many endured about 150 more days of dangerous heat than they would have done without global heating, almost half the year.

```bash
effect == impact
endure == suffer  忍受；持续，持久，坚持下去(e.g. These traditions have endured throughout the ages.)
about 150 more days 150多天
```

Nearly half the world’s countries endured at least two months of high-risk temperatures. Even in the least affected places, such as the UK, US and Australia, the carbon pollution from fossil fuel burning has led to an extra three weeks of elevated temperatures.

Worsened heatwaves are the deadliest consequence of the climate emergency. <span style="color: red;">An end to coal, oil and gas burning was vital to stopping the effects getting even worse</span> , the scientists said, with 2024 forecast to be the hottest year on record with record-high carbon emissions.

```bash
Worsened heatwaves 日益加剧的酷热
deadliest consequence 最致命的后果
hottest year on record 最热的年份
record-high carbon emissions 最高的碳排放量
vital - important - crucial - significant
```

The researchers called for deaths from heatwaves to be reported in real time, with current data being a “very gross underestimate” because of the lack of monitoring(监管). It is possible that uncounted millions of people have died as a result of human-caused global heating in recent decades.

```bash
in real time 
current data 现有的数据
very gross(严重的、显著的；总体的) underestimate 非常不准确的估计
## estimate - value -evaluate
## overestimate && underestimate
```

“The impacts of fossil fuel warming have never been clearer or more devastating than in 2024 and caused unrelenting suffering,” said Dr Friederike Otto, of Imperial College London and the co-lead of WWA. “The floods in Spain, hurricanes in the US, drought in the Amazon, and floods across Africa are just a few examples. We know exactly what we need to do to stop things from getting worse: stop burning fossil fuels.”

```bash
devastating/ˈdevəsteɪtɪŋ/ 破坏性的 devastate -v 破坏
disaster 灾难  disastrous 灾难性的  catastrophe 大灾难 catastrophic 大灾难的 calamity  /kəˈlæmɪti/ 灾难
```


Joseph Giguere, a research technician at Climate Central, said: “Almost everywhere on Earth, daily temperatures hot enough to threaten human health have become more common because of climate change.”



The Guardian revealed in November that the climate crisis had caused dozens of previously impossible heatwaves, as well as making hundreds of other extreme weather events more severe or more likely to happen.

```bash
dozens of 大量的
more liekly to -- prone to 
```

The new analysis identified local “dangerous heat days” by calculating the threshold temperature for the hottest 10% of days from 1991-2020. These days are associated with increased health risks.

The researchers then compared the number of days exceeding this threshold in 2024 to those in a scenario without global heating to calculate how many extra hot days were caused by the climate crisis.

They found the average person was exposed to a further 41 days of dangerous heat, highlighting how the climate crisis was exposing millions more people to dangerous temperatures for longer periods of the year.

Indonesia, home to 280 million people, experienced 122 days of additional dangerous heat, as did Singapore and many Central American states.

In the Middle East, people in Saudi Arabia endured 70 additional hot days, in a year when at least 1,300 hajj pilgrims died during extreme heat.

Brazil and Bangladesh endured about 50 extra hot days, while Spain, Norway and the Balkan countries had an additional month of high temperatures.

Five billion people, almost two-thirds of the global population, experienced raised temperatures made at least twice as likely by global heating on 21 July, one of the hottest days of the year.

Hurricanes were also supercharged by the climate crisis in 2024. Kristina Dahl, the vice-president for science at Climate Central, said: “Our analyses have shown that every Atlantic hurricane this year was made stronger by climate change, and that hurricanes Beryl and Milton, which were both category five storms, would not have reached that level were it not for climate change.”

Recent WWA analysis showed that an extraordinary sequence of six typhoons in the Philippines in 30 days, which affected 13 million people, was made more likely and more severe by global heating.

Julie Arrighi, the programmes director at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: “Another devastating year of extreme weather has shown that we are not well prepared for life at [the current level] of warming. In 2025, it’s crucial that every country accelerates efforts to adapt to climate change and that funds are provided by rich nations to help developing countries become more resilient.”

Measures should include better early warning systems, which saved lives, and the reporting of heat deaths, the researchers said.

“In most countries there is no reporting on heatwaves at all, which means the numbers we have are always a very gross underestimate,” Otto said. “If we can’t communicate convincingly that actually lots of people are dying, it’s much harder to raise awareness that heatwaves are <span style="color: red;">by far</span> the deadliest extreme events, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real gamechanger.”

“在大多数国家，根本没有关于热浪的报道，这意味着我们掌握的数据总是严重低估了实际情况，”奥托说。“如果我们不能令人信服地说明确实有很多人因此死亡，那么就很难让人们意识到，热浪是**迄今为止**最致命的极端事件，而且在这类极端事件中，气候变化确实起到了改变游戏规则的作用。”

```bash
communicate convincingly 有说服力的交流
raise awareness 提高警觉
by far == until now 目前为止
```
