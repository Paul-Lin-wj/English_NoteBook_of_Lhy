We’re a father-and-daughter <span style="color: red;">duo</span> working on our sheep and beef farm in north Devon. Despite our farm being relatively small, we too have been feeling the <span style="color: red;">immediate stress</span> and worry of <span style="color: red;">Labour</span>’s budget announcements, and thousands of others are similarly feeling the strain (Tax changes in budget last straw for UK farmers after ‘years of being squeezed’, 8 November).

Mental health has always been a <span style="color: red;">massive</span> issue in the farming industry. There are so many <span style="color: red;">uncontrollable</span> <span style="color: red;">variables</span> <span style="color: red;">to contend with</span>: disease, climate, supermarket prices, <span style="color: red;">not to mention</span> all of the <span style="color: red;">uncertainties</span> following <span style="color: red;">Brexit</span>. We’re literally counting trees and measuring <span style="color: red;">hedgerows</span> <span style="color: red;">in a bid to</span> <span style="color: red;">claw back</span> money lost since leaving the EU, as if we somehow need to prove we’re <span style="color: red;">custodians</span> of the countryside. A complete <span style="color: red;">mockery</span>.

And now farmers have suddenly been told that we will have to <span style="color: red;">magic up</span> hundreds of thousands of pounds to keep on farming our land into the future. Where do they think this is going to come from? We’re not wealthy and our hours worked don’t come close to <span style="color: red;">minimum wage</span>. The farming families that I know all work other jobs to help keep their farms <span style="color: red;">afloat</span>. Yes, farms are <span style="color: red;">asset-rich</span> – but please don’t call us millionaires: we don’t get to see that money. It’s a livelihood and way of life that has passed down – something we’ve grown up doing and been involved with since we were born – and we <span style="color: red;">take great pride in</span> producing high-welfare, high-quality food.

This is far worse than feeling angry at the liars in <span style="color: red;">Westminster</span>; we feel sick about our future and don’t want to see our livelihoods disappear. We’re told there may be ways to gift things over, but this takes seven years to <span style="color: red;">take effect</span>. For the majority of us, our parents are <span style="color: red;">getting on in years</span>, some are ill – life insurance isn’t even an option – so are we just supposed to pray? <span style="color: red;">Labour</span> told us before the election that it wouldn’t change inheritance tax <span style="color: red;">relief</span>: it even said the <span style="color: red;">rumours</span> were “<span style="color: red;">desperate nonsense</span>”.

Food security is a serious issue. We all need to eat. I’ve heard people say the government only <span style="color: red;">values its farmers</span> in times of war – but by that time it’s too late. We must make this government think again and realise the <span style="color: red;">implications</span> for the whole country. No farmers, no food. This affects everyone.
