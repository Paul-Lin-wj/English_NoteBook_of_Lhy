For these companies, economies of scale, low wages, minimum staffing and cost-cutting are <span style="color:red">the order of the day</span>, writes Norman Edwards

Your <span style="color:red">editorial</span> on the failures of the <span style="color:red">privatisation</span> of care services (7 October) rightly highlights the shameful situation that has developed for older people in residential care. The Nuffield Foundation's research clearly shows that the increasing <span style="color:red">outsourcing</span> of this provision <span style="color:red">is associated with</span> lower standards of care.

I have known many care home staff and managers, but never known any who do not want the best for their residents. However, nearly all the largest private providers of care home places for older people are now owned by <span style="color:red">offshore private equity companies</span> for whom profit is the prime motivation. For these companies, economies of scale, low wages, minimum staffing and cost-cutting are <span style="color:red">the order of the day</span>. They open larger and larger care homes, often built on cheap land, well away from local communities. These <span style="color:red">silos of residents</span>, many of whom live out their last few months in <span style="color:red">loneliness and isolation</span>, pay tens of thousands of pounds a year for the <span style="color:red">privilege</span>. They often have to spend their savings, and most likely will sell their house to fund their care.

<span style="color:red">Alongside</span> this, in recent years, we have the publicly <span style="color:red">acknowledged</span> failings of the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, which cannot seem to <span style="color:red">hold</span> these care <span style="color:red">conglomerates</span> to <span style="color:red">account</span>, or indeed manage their own activities. Furthermore, every day there are many thousands of beds being occupied in hospitals because places in care homes do not exist, adding to our <span style="color:red">scandalously</span> long waiting lists.

Is it right that frail, sick and vulnerable elderly people should be used simply as <span style="color:red">profit generators</span> for these companies? Many of us had high hopes when Wes Streeting <span style="color:red">proclaimed</span> his "National Care Service", but beyond <span style="color:red">perversely</span> announcing even greater use of the private sector, very little government policy has emerged to solve the <span style="color:red">long-standing failures</span> in residential care <span style="color:red">provision</span>.

```bash

provision 供应；条款；规定；预备；准备
